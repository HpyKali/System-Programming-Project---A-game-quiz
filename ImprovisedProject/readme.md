    Main libraries
        **tkinter** (tkinter helps a lot when it comes to GUI as it has many libraries and pre built code inside of it to avoid writing from scratch this helps a lot to understand the code as the program depends on it at 90%)
        Within tkinter you can one organize the GUI to your prefered way with ease.
